#This is my first attempt at building a trading bot.  Trading Strategy below:
#Breakout strategy - the bot will purchase a stock when it identifies it is on the rise
#Stop-loss strategy - the bot will sell a stock when it identifies it is falling
#Both strategies will utilize a volatility adjusted lockback length approach
